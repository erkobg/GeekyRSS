        <h3>GeekyRSS.</h3>

<h1>Android application for following RSS feeds, with possibility to read articles in offline mode</h1>

<hr><p><strong>Target API</strong> : 8 ( Android 2.2 Froyo)</p>

<p><strong>Activities</strong> : 5 </p>

<p><strong>Services</strong> : 1 (background job to check old articles)</p>

<p><strong>Time used</strong>:
several hours (1-2) for 7 days, just when I had the chance  </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When the application starts, the user is able to see a list of all the feeds that he subscribed to along with the number of read and unread news for each feed. The user is able to subscribe to a new feed by providing its URL as well as unsubscribe from existing feeds. In the context menu there is add new feed, and when "Long hold" on the specific Feed - there comes context menu with Sync and Delete option.
Syncing of the news is done automatically when the initial screen is loaded if the application finds that there is network (Wi-Fi or Mobile data) connection - you can see progress in the progress bar in the bottom of the Feeds List activity. 
All the feeds (title, text, URL to the real news, picture and any additional data) are stored in a database for offline reviewing. </p>

<p>When the user clicks on a feed from the initial screen, all the news items that it contains are presented on a new screen in a way that the new (unread) ones can be distinguished from the old - readed ones are Strikethrough styled. A news item is considered old if it is opened. The user is also able to look at a list of featured news from all the feeds that they have subscribed to. Featured news is one that contains a key word or a sequence of words in its title or summarized text. The user is able to manipulate, i.e. add or delete, the list of key words. This is done from a dedicated screen.</p>

<p>There is a background job that regularly checks if the database contains too many entries and that cleans up the oldest ones (in our case - the older than 10 days).</p>

<p><strong>Permissions:</strong>
<strong>android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> -  used for SQLite database creation</p>

<p><strong>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong> - used for checking whether there is internet connection in order to sync</p>

<p><strong>android.permission.INTERNET</strong> - used to sync Feeds and Articles</p>

<p><strong>Todo's:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> handle all locking cases</li>
<li> optimize performance</li>
<li> stabilize overall stability of the app (still a lot of crashing)</li>
<li>  test it more (I didn't had the time to try all possible scenarios)</li>
<li> provide configuration option to specify time interval for deleting old articles</li>
<li> show loading /progress when adding new feed</li>
<li> make reading Articles possible with slide left/right (using Fragments)</li>
<li>and so on...</li>
</ul><p><strong>Screenshots:</strong></p>
